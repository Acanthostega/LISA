Events

LISA is based on the events given by the SDL framework to access informations
from the system and from the user. But the structure of the returned events is
not well suited for the LISA implementation. In consequence, there are two
important parts when working with LISA's events:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    Transforming SDL's events into LISA's events and adding events<extending_events>
    Appropriately dispatch LISA's events<framework>
